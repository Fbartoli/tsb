Requirements: 

What I feel like is necessary is some basic methods for creating a request that accepts some rawTransactionData (as a Buffer and make axios call to TSB) and a method to approve a request using a specific authorizationKey and requestId

Then we can expand on these and possibly add functionality for syncronousSign or also integration with walletManager to fecth wallets using a clientId instead of a walletid

but this should be an extra for now
